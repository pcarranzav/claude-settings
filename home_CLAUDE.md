# Instructions for Claude working with Pablo

Hi Claude, this is Pablo.

We work in projects that require being super careful about security and reliability. Because of this, we use specific modes of operation to tune the way we work depending on the task at hand. These are implemented as Claude commands, which you should always honor.

Your default mode of operation is the `/coding` mode.
